# HaMeR: Hand Mesh Recovery

## Installation

First, install Python 3.10:
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.10 python3.10-venv
```

Then create and activate the virtual environment:
```bash
python3.10 -m venv .hamer
source .hamer/bin/activate
```

Then, you can install the rest of the dependencies. This is for CUDA 11.7, but you can adapt accordingly:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
pip install -e .[all]
pip install -v -e third-party/ViTPose
```

You also need to download the trained models:
```bash
bash fetch_demo_data.sh
```

Besides these files, you also need to download the MANO model. Please visit the [MANO website](https://mano.is.tue.mpg.de) and register to get access to the downloads section.  We only require the right hand model. You need to put `MANO_RIGHT.pkl` under the `_DATA/data/mano` folder.
